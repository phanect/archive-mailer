    code that creates the shadow lives in the menu's public "onRender" 
    event handler that is a prototype method of YAHOO.widget.Menu.  
    Implementers wishing to remove a menu's shadow or add any other markup
    required for a given skin for menu should override the "onRender" method.

PLEASE NOTE: There are two known issues with YAHOO.widget.Overlay (and its 
subclasses) that manifest in Gecko-based browsers on Mac OS X:

1) Elements with scrollbars will poke through Overlay instances floating 
   above them.

2) If an Overlay instance contains child elements with scrollbars, those
   scrollbars will remain visible after the Overlay is hidden.

To fix these bugs in Menu (a subclass of Overlay):

1) The "overflow" property of a Menu instance's shadow element is toggled 
   between "hidden" and "auto" through the application and removal of the 
   "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" classes (see below) as its 
   "visibility" configuration property is toggled between "false" and "true."
   These classes are applied only for Gecko on Mac OS X and are added/removed 
   to/from the Menu's root HTML element (DIV) via the 
   "hideMacGeckoScrollbars" and "showMacGeckoScrollbars" methods of  
   YAHOO.widget.Overlay.

2) The "overflow" property of a Menu instance's child nodes is 
   set to "hidden" when it is hidden and the "display" property of HTML 
   <SELECT> elements are set to "none" (see below).

* For more information on this issue, see:

+ SourceForge bug #1723530

The following style rule (".yuimenu.show-scrollbars") overrides the 
".show-scrollbars" rule defined in container-core.css which sets the 
"overflow" property of a YAHOO.widget.Overlay instance's root HTML element to 
"auto" when it is visible.  Without this override, a Menu would have scrollbars
when one of its submenus is visible.
