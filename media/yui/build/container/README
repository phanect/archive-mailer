Container Release Notes

*** version 2.3 ***

Fixed the following bugs:
-------------------------

+ Improved creation of the <iframe> element used to monitor changes to the 
  browser's font size so that:
  
    - Safari's status bar no longer displays a "Loading..." message after the 
      page has loaded.
  
    - Firefox no longer reports duplicate cookie information.
    
    - The browser scrollbars no longer flash on and off in Firefox.

+ It is now possible to set the "button" configuration property of a 
  YAHOO.widget.Dialog instance after it has be rendered.

+ Form elements appended to a YAHOO.widget.Dialog instance via the "setBody"
  method are now automatically registered using the "registerForm" method.

+ The "focusFirst" method of YAHOO.widget.Dialog will no longer result in a 
  JavaScript error in IE if the first element in the Dialog instance's form
  is a radio button.

+ YAHOO.widget.Panel instances whose "draggable" property is set to "true" and
  "width" property is set to "auto" are now able to be dragged in IE 6 (Quirks
  and Strict Mode) and IE 7 Quirks Mode.

+ Updated focus methods of YAHOO.widget.Dialog to prevent JavaScript errors 
  that result from trying to set focus to elements that hidden or disabled.

+ Pressing the enter key will no longer result in a YAHOO.widget.Dialog 
  instance's "validate" method being called twice.

+ Pressing the enter key while focused on a form field inside a Dialog will no
  longer trigger the "click" event handler defined by the Dialog's default 
  button in IE and Firefox.

+ Pressing the enter key when focused on a form field inside a 
  YAHOO.widget.Dialog instance with no buttons created via its "buttons" 
  configuration property will no longer result in a JavaScript error.

+ Aqua scrollbars will no longer bleed through Container widgets in Firefox
  for Mac OS X.

+ The "width" and "height" configuration properties of YAHOO.widget.Overlay
  now supersede the "fixedcenter" and "context" configuration properties to 
  ensure correct positioning of Overlay instances using the "fixedcenter" 
  and "context" configuration properties.

+ Calling the "destroy" method on a YAHOO.widget.Overlay instance no longer 
  results in a JavaScript error on the subsequent focus of another 
  Overlay instance.

+ YAHOO.widget.Tooltip instances without a value specified for the "width" 
  configuration property will be rendered at a width equal to the offsetWidth
  of their root <DIV/> element to prevent their width from being clipped or 
  constrained by their parent HTML element.


Changes:
--------

+ Rendering of YAHOO.widget.Tooltip instances is now deferred using the 
  "onDOMReady" event handler of YAHOO.util.Event rather than waiting until 
  the "load" event of the Tooltip's parent window fires.

+ Deprecated "browser" property of YAHOO.widget.Module in favor 
  of YAHOO.env.ua.

+ The "moveEvent" of a YAHOO.widget.Panel instance now also fires with the 
  "endDrag" event of the its YAHOO.util.DD instance.

+ Updated modal functionality of YAHOO.widget.Panel:
    
    - The creation of a Panel instance's modality mask is now deferred until it
      is initially made visible.

    - Showing a modal Panel instance will now result in the Panel and its 
      associated modality mask element having a higher z-index than all other
      YAHOO.widget.Overlay instances and Overlay subclasses.

+ Updated the "underlay" configuration property of YAHOO.widget.Panel:

    - The creation of the "underlay" element is deferred until the Panel
      instance is initially made visible.

    - The underlay elment is always created for Gecko-based browsers on Mac
      OS X as it is used as a shim to prevent Aqua scrollbars from poking 
      through a Panel instance.

+ Updated the "buttons" configuration property of YAHOO.widget.Dialog:

    - YAHOO.widget.Button is now an optional dependancy, and if included, each
      button in a Dialog will be an instance of Button.

    - The "text" property of each button now accepts HTML
    
    - The "handler" property of each button can now be set to:
    
        + A reference to a function that should fire when the button is 
          clicked.  (In this case scope of this function is always its 
          Dialog instance.)

        + An object literal representing the code to be executed when the 
          button is clicked.  The format is:  
          {
            fn: Function (The handler to call when the event fires.),
            obj: Object (An object to pass back to the handler.),
            scope: Object (The object to use for the scope of the handler.)
          }   


Added the following features:
-----------------------------

+ Added ability for YAHOO.widget.Tooltip instances to have shadow:

    - The shadow for a Tooltip is implemented by appending a new element as the 
      last child of its root <DIV/> element:

        <DIV class="yui-tt">
            <DIV class="bd"> ... </DIV>
            <DIV class="yui-tt-shadow"/>
        </DIV>

    - The code that creates the shadow element resides inside the Tooltip's 
      public "onRender" prototype method.  To disable the creation of a 
      Tooltip's shadow override the prototype of the "onRender" method:
      
      YAHOO.widget.Tooltip.prototype.onRender = null;
      
    - The actual creation of the shadow element is deferred until the Tooltip 
      is made visible for the first time.

    - A Tooltip's shadow element can be styled via two CSS classes:

        + "yui-tt-shadow"  - Applied to the shadow element when it is created.
        + "yui-tt-shadow-visible" - Applied to the shadow element when the  
          Tooltip is visible; it is removed the Tooltip is hidden.

    - The shadow element is only styled with the new "Sam" skin.

+ Prototype of all classes (Module, Overlay, Panel, Dialog, SimpleDialog,  
  Tooltip, Config, and ContainerEffect) are augmented 
  with YAHOO.util.EventProvider, facilitating subscribing to an instance's 
  Custom Events by name via a "subscribe" method that is a direct member of 
  the class.  For example:
  
    var oOverlay = new YAHOO.widget.Overlay("myoverlay");
    
    oOverlay.subscribe("show", onShow);

+ Added "bringToTop" method to YAHOO.widget.Overlay that places the Overlay on 
  top of all other Overlay instances.

+ Added a new "bringToTop" method to YAHOO.widget.OverlayManager that places 
  the specified Overlay instance on top of all other Overlay instances.  This 
  method is called on each Overlay instance that is registered with an 
  OverlayManager instance.

+ Dialog instances are now able to upload files should the Dialog instance's 
  form contain <input type="file"/> elements.  PLEASE NOTE: If a Dialog 
  instance will be handling asyncronous file uploads, its "callback" property 
  will need to be setup with an "upload" handler rather than the standard 
  "success" and, or "failure" handlers.  For more information, see the 
  Connection Manager documenation on file uploads:
  http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/#file

+ Added a new "getButtons" method to YAHOO.widget.Dialog that returns an array 
  containing each of the Dialog's buttons; by default an array of HTML <BUTTON>
  elements.  If the Dialog's buttons were created using the 
  YAHOO.widget.Button class (via the inclusion of the optional Button
  dependancy on the page), an array of YAHOO.widget.Button instances 
  is returned.


*** version 2.2.2 ***

+ Clicking the close button of a Panel (or any instance of a Panel subclass) 
  registered with an OverlayManager will no longer result in the Panel 
  receiving focus.

+ Overlay instances registered with an OverlayManager will now correctly 
  blur themselves when hidden.

+ Calling the "destroy" method of an Overlay instance will now result in it 
  being removed from its OverlayManager instance(s).

+ The DOM event listener for the event defined by the "focusevent" 
  configuration property of an OverlayManager instance is now removed from each 
  Overlay instance when it is removed from its OverlayManager.

+ All subscribers for an Overlay instance's "focus" and "blur" events are 
  now unsubscribed when it is removed from its OverlayManager.


*** version 2.2.1 ***

+ Made the default scope for all Custom Events published by Module, Overlay, 
  Panel, Tooltip, Dialog and SimpleDialog the widget instance.  Previously the 
  default scope for Custom Events was inconsistent across classes; the default
  scope for Custom Events published by Overlay was always the Overlay instance
  whereas the Custom Events published by all of the other classes had no 
  default scope.  

+ Added default scope for CustomEvents published by YAHOO.util.Config:
  - Default scope for the "configChangedEvent" is now the Config instance.
  - Default scope for Config property events is now the Config's owner (widget).

+ Panel and Tooltip now always convert the value of a DOM element's "tagName" 
  property to uppercase before evaluating it.  This improves 
  XHTML compatibility.
  
+ Pressing the enter key while focused on a form field inside a Dialog will 
  now trigger the "click" event handler defined by the Dialog's default 
  button in IE and Firefox.  Previously, this behavior only worked in Safari 
  and Opera.

+ Added a "yui" prefix to the default CSS class name for Module to be 
  consistent with the other Container family widgets.

+ Container/Panel's underlay shadow is now defined as partially-transparent
  black rather than gray.  This prevents the shadow from lightening the 
  background color of elements beneath it.

+ Fixed memory leaks in Panel and Dialog.

+ The Drag and Drop library is now a truly optional dependency for Panel and its 
  subclasses.

+ Panel "focus" and "blur" events are now fired when Panels are focused and 
  blurred via the "focus" and "blurAll" methods of YAHOO.widget.OverlayManager.

+ Panel instances rendered without setting the value for the "width" 
  configuration property will now have their "width" configuration 
  property set to the value of the Panel's element's "offsetWidth" property 
  when rendered.  This fixes an issue in IE 6 and 7 where Panels that are 
  rendered without setting the "width" configuration property will only be 
  draggable by mousing down on the text inside the header, rather than anywhere 
  inside the header.
  
+ Refactored the Container family including the Config class to improve 
  performance, especially when working with a large number of instances in IE6.
