PLEASE NOTE: There are two known issues with YAHOO.widget.Overlay (and its 
subclasses) that manifest in Gecko-based browsers on Mac OS X:

1) Elements with scrollbars will poke through Overlay instances floating 
   above them.

2) If an Overlay instance contains child elements with scrollbars, those
   scrollbars will remain visible after the Overlay is hidden.

To fix these bugs:

1) The "overflow" property of an Overlay instance's root element (or underlay 
   elment in the case of Panel and its subclasses) is toggled between
   "hidden" and "auto" through the application and removal of the 
   "hide-scrollbars" and "show-scrollbars" classes (see below) as its 
   "visibility" configuration property is toggled between "false" and "true."
   These classes are applied only for Gecko on Mac OS X and are added/removed 
   to/from the Overlay's root HTML element (DIV) via the 
   "hideMacGeckoScrollbars" and "showMacGeckoScrollbars" methods of  
   YAHOO.widget.Overlay.

2) The "overflow" property of an Overlay instance's child nodes is
   set to "hidden" and the "display" property of child HTML 
   <SELECT> elements that a child nodes of the Overlay instance's root element 
   are set to "none" (see below) when it is hidden.
