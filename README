What works:
reading email.... that's about it for now

temporary install notes:
have to rename the directory to django_webmail since python doesn't like hyphens in module names... whoops


Requirements:
django (1.3ish)
python-simplejson (part of newer python's I think)
imapclient (pip install imapclient)
probably python-2.5
